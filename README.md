About FAOSTAT
=============
[FAOSTAT](http://faostat3.fao.org/) is maintained by the [Statistics Division](http://www.fao.org/statistics) of the [Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/). In working directly with the countries, the Statistics Division supports the development of national statistical strategies, the strengthening of Institution and technical capacities, and the improvement of statistical systems.

The FAOSTAT system is one of FAO’s most important corporate systems. It is a major component of FAO’s information systems, contributing to the organization’s strategic objective of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture for development and the fight against global hunger and malnutrition.
